# KaBamazon: Katy's Bamazon
A storefront on the CLI using Node and MySQL

The Customer portal displays a table with the items, their ids, and the amount for each product.

The customer chooses a product by entering the id and how much the of the item the customer wants. If the id is valid and there is enough stock, the customer gets a receipt for the order, which includes Texas sales tax and an option to shop again.
